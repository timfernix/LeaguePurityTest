<h1>timfernix' League Purity Test v2.0</h1></div>
<h6>Last updated: August 23th 2024 @ 11:31AM EET</h6>
  <p id="how-to">Welcome to my League of Legends Purity Test. This test is designed to gauge your LoL experience and habits. Simply click on all the statements that apply to you. As you go through the test, you'll notice a mix of positive and negative statements. That's because your score can be negative if you've made some... questionable choices in-game. Once you've clicked on all the statements that apply to you, choose a background image to personalize your results (at least a little bit). Finally, click on "Show Results" to see your score! <br><br>Note: Some of the questions are inspired by my first version of the League Purity Test that i posted on <a href="https://x.com/timfernix/status/1825226833777840179/photo/1"><i class="fa-brands fa-x-twitter"></i>Twitter </a>,but i added many more to make it even better. So, be honest and have fun! <br><br></p>
